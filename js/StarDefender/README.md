# StarDefender
A game written in JavaScript and HTML5<br>
Description:<br>
	Star Defender is a point-click tower defense game based on Starcraft with a resource pool and multiple types of enemies that head down lanes towards your main base. You can place multiple types of defensive structures along the lane’s paths to defend your base. Waves of enemies will spawn on a timer, but beware each wave gets more difficult, after all waves have been defeated you win the round and move on to the next map. If your base’s health reaches zero you lose! Build as if your life depends on it!<br>
  Game Summary:<br>
  Animated Resources:<br>
  Game will feature many characters from the Starcraft universe, as animated sprites from the original Starcraft will be enemies walking through lanes that must be destroyed before reaching the user’s base. The user will have the option to build towers which can kill the enemies, with towers shooting animated projectiles at the enemies currently painted on the canvas. Towers will also be Starcraft themed, and we hope to implement strengths and weaknesses of towers/enemies in a manner that stays true to the spirit of the original Starcraft. If time allows, we are considering further animations of user spells - but our main focus are the towers and enemies.
