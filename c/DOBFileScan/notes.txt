next year..
search for duplicates in preexisting array
-if you dont find it, append it to the end of array
-if you do find it append new number for year

When you first create arrays for int, initiliaze them all to -1 (unranked)
To read in names, read them as chars, stopping at commas, then create the string yourself.
To read in int, use %d
There will still be an EOF for next name, so first scanf(" %c") then after use "%c". or use discardToEOL() after int.

while (*string) {
} //Will take you to '\0'
