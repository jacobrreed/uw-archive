/**
 * 
 * Humans move in a random direction (straight, left, or right), always on grass or crosswalks.
 * A human never reverses direction unless there is no other option.
 * If a human is next to a crosswalk it will always 
 * choose to turn to face in the direction of the crosswalk.
 * (The map of terrain will never contain crosswalks that
 * are so close together that a human might be
 * adjacent to more than one at the same time.)
 * Humans do not travel through crosswalks when the crosswalk
 * light is green. If a human is facing a green
 * crosswalk, it will wait until the light changes to yellow 
 * and then cross through the crosswalk. The
 * human will not turn to avoid the crosswalk.
 * Humans travel through crosswalks when the crosswalk light is yellow or red.
 * Humans ignore the color of traffic lights.
 * Collision behavior: A human dies if it collides with any living 
 * vehicle except another human, and stays
 * dead for 50 moves.
