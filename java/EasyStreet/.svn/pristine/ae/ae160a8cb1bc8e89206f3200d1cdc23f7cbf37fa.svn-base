 * Trucks travel only on streets and through lights and crosswalks.
 * Trucks randomly select to go straight, turn left, or turn right. 
 * As a last resort, if none of these three,
 * directions is legal (all not streets, lights, or crosswalks), the truck turns around.
 * Trucks drive through all traffic lights without stopping!
 * Trucks stop for red crosswalk lights, but drive through yellow or
 * green crosswalk lights without,
 * stopping.
 * Collision behavior: A truck survives a collision with anything, living or dead.
