/**
 * 
 * Cars can only travel on streets and through lights and crosswalks.
 * A car prefers to drive straight ahead on the street if it can. 
 * If it cannot move straight ahead, it turns left
 * if possible; if it cannot turn left, it turns right if possible; 
 * as a last resort, it turns around.
 * Cars stop for red lights; if a traffic light is immediately ahead 
 * of the car and the light is red, the car stays
 * still and does not move. It does not turn to avoid the light. When
 *  the light turns green, the car resumes its
 * original direction.
 * Cars ignore yellow and green lights.
 * Cars stop for red and yellow crosswalk lights, but drive through 
 * green crosswalk lights without stopping.
 * Collision behavior: A car dies if it collides with a living truck, 
 * and stays dead for 10 moves.
