/**
 * 
 * Taxis can only travel on streets and through lights and crosswalks.
 * A taxi prefers to drive straight ahead if it can. If it cannot move 
 * straight ahead, it turns left if possible; if
 * it cannot turn left, it turns right if possible; as a last resort, it turns around.
 * Taxis stop for red lights; if a traffic light is immediately ahead of the 
 * taxi and the light is red, the Taxi
 * stays still and does not move until the light turns green. It does not turn 
 * to avoid the light. When the light
 * turns green the taxi resumes its original direction. Taxis ignore yellow and green lights.
 * Taxis stop for (temporarily) red crosswalk lights. If a crosswalk light is 
 * immediately ahead of the taxi
 * and the crosswalk light is red, the Taxi stays still and does not move for
 * 3 clock cycles or until the
 * crosswalk light turns green, whichever occurs first. It does not turn to avoid
 * the crosswalk light. When
 * the crosswalk light turns green, or after 3 clock cycles, whichever happens
 * first, the taxi resumes its
 * original direction. A Taxi will drive through yellow or green crosswalk
 * lights without stopping.
 * Collision behavior: A taxi dies if it collides with a 
 * living truck, and stays dead for 10 moves.
